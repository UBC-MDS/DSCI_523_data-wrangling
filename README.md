# DSCI 523: Data Wrangling

Converting data from the form in which it is collected to the form needed for analysis. How to clean, filter, arrange, aggregate, and transform diverse data types, e.g. strings, numbers, and date-times.

## Course Learning Objectives

By the end of the course, students are expected to be able to:

  1. Manipulate a single data table like: 
      
      1.1 filtering rows based on a criterion or combination of criteria; 
      
      1.2 selecting variables; rearranging the observations or variables in a deliberate way (e.g., sorting, grouping); 
      
      1.3 creating new variables from one or more existing variables; 
      
      1.4 reshaping data; 
      
      1.5 computing summaries on groups of observations based on one or more categorical variables.
  
  1. Use regular expressions to handle strings;
  
  1. Deal with dates and times; 

  1. Work with more than one table 
  
  1. Detect and handle duplicates and outliers.

  1. Determine appropriate manipulations for two-table data, including lookups and joins with suitably-selected columns.
